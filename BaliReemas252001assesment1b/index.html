    	<h2>aLiving Style guide is important to designers and developers because......</h2>
    	
    		<p>As web applications become more complex and layered in todayâ€™s world developers and designers must always look for new ways to keep on top
				of documentation and efficiency, the living style guide tool helps to easily accomplish this. Organising front-end codebases into well described 
                patterns and libraries with minimal effort is the forefront objective of the tool. 	<cite>&#40;Haritonvo 2015&#41;</cite>  This in turn helps both developers and 
				designers stay on track with creation and know that if changes need to be made to the program in the future they can be easily identified and
				dealt with. Furthermore if the project in question becomes larger; intern needing more developers and designers to help create it. Having a 
 				style guide will mean saving time in the CSS design process while also maintaining design consistency. This is because all styles and the general 
 				outlook of the already created web project would have been documented prior, therefore anyone new that starts to contribute to development would
                be able to refer to the guide for reference and assistance of what exact styles to use. <cite>&#40;Robertson 2014&#41;</cite>
